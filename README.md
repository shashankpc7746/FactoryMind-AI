## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- ✅ **Python 3.10 or higher** - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- ✅ **Node.js 18 or higher** - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- ✅ **Git** - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- ✅ **Groq API Key** - [Get free API key](https://console.groq.com/)
- ✅ **HuggingFace API Key** - [Get free API key](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)

### 📥 Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, let's get the code onto your machine:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shashankpc7746/FactoryMind-AI.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd FactoryMind-AI
```

### 🐍 Step 2: Backend Setup

#### Create Virtual Environment

It's a best practice to use a virtual environment to keep your dependencies isolated:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'fact-ai'
python -m venv fact-ai

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
fact-ai\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source fact-ai/bin/activate
```

You should see `(fact-ai)` appear in your terminal prompt, indicating the virtual environment is active.

#### Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
# Install all required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install FastAPI, LangChain, FAISS, and all other dependencies. It may take 2-3 minutes.

#### Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
copy .env.example .env

# On macOS/Linux:
cp .env.example .env
```

Now open the `.env` file in your favorite text editor and add your API keys:

```env
# Required API Keys
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key_here

# Optional: Configure CORS (add your frontend URL)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173

# Optional: Customize upload limits
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760  # 10MB default
```

💡 **Pro Tip:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already in `.gitignore`.

#### Start the Backend Server

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Start the FastAPI server
python main.py
```

You should see output like:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

✅ **Backend is now running at:** `http://localhost:8000`

📖 **API Documentation available at:** `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### 🎨 Step 3: Frontend Setup

Open a **new terminal window** (keep the backend running in the first one).

#### Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root directory
npm install
```

This will install React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and all UI components. Takes about 1-2 minutes.

#### Configure Frontend Environment (Optional)

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
copy .env.local.example .env.local

# On macOS/Linux:
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

By default, the frontend connects to `http://localhost:8000`. If your backend runs on a different URL, update `.env.local`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

#### Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
  VITE v5.x.x  ready in xxx ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

✅ **Frontend is now running at:** `http://localhost:5173`

### 🎉 Step 4: Explore the Application!

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`. You'll see the FactoryMind AI dashboard!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### ❌ "Module not found" Error (Python)

**Problem:** Missing Python dependencies

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

#### ❌ "API Key not found" Error

**Problem:** Environment variables not configured

**Solution:**
1. Check that `.env` file exists in project root
2. Verify it contains your API keys
3. Restart the backend server

#### ❌ Frontend Can't Connect to Backend

**Problem:** CORS or connection issues

**Solution:**
1. Verify backend is running: `http://localhost:8000/health`
2. Check `.env` has correct `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
3. Verify `.env.local` has correct `VITE_API_URL`
4. Check browser console for CORS errors

#### ❌ FAISS Installation Fails (Windows)

**Problem:** Binary wheel compatibility

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install faiss-cpu --no-cache-dir
```

#### ❌ Port Already in Use

**Problem:** Port 8000 or 5173 is occupied

**Solution:**

For backend (port 8000):
```bash
# Find the process
netstat -ano | findstr :8000

# Kill the process (replace PID)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

For frontend (port 5173):
```bash
# Find the process
netstat -ano | findstr :5173

# Kill the process
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

#### ❌ Upload Fails - File Too Large

**Problem:** File exceeds size limit

**Solution:** Update `MAX_FILE_SIZE` in `.env`:
```env
MAX_FILE_SIZE=20971520  # 20MB
```

#### ❌ Slow Response Times

**Possible causes:**
- First query after idle time (vector store loading)
- Large documents being processed
- Groq API rate limits

**Solutions:**
- Wait for initial load to complete
- Split large PDFs into smaller chunks
- Check Groq API usage limits
